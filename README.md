# Logichat
Logichat is a scalable anonymous web-based chat application (Logichat) using HTML/CSS/JS (for front-end development) and Node.js/AWS/MongoDB/ExpressJS/PubNub (for back-end development). Any number of users will be greeted by a clean user interface that will show that they are speaking anonymously and how many active users are on the chat at any given time. Behind the user interface, the application is connected to a socket.io websocket controlled by npm (a javascript package manager), which constantly communicates with mongoDB (our database for storing messages in each session and verifying whether users are duplicates) and Amazon Web Services (hosting the website). The application also communicates with PubNub for real-time user analytics (number of users, messages sent, connections dropped, packet analysis) through AWS and uses ExpressJS as the web server. When the application is running, it can be accessed at (18.222.224.106:5000). The program was tested for anonymous communication when first launched within the Cisco Global STEM internship.
